## How to Use This Application
------------------------------

* `compile`, runs the tsc command and compiles the project
<br>
    Example: 
    ```
    npm run compile
    ```

* `start`, runs index.js file in the dist folder (which is created with the compile command)
<br>
    Example: 
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    
* `build`, runs both the start, and compile commands together:
<br>
    Example:
